## USER STORIES:
All application features or functionalities should be defined as user stories. So any development that happens should be associated with a user story. The following format should be used for writing the user story:

**As a** < type of user >, 
**I want** < some goal >,
**so that** < some reason >

User stories to be created as cards on the [**Trello Project Board**](https://trello.com/b/mfRS3FtK/chingu-voyage-3-toucans-26).
