                        <p class="header">Why gIve?</p>
                        <p>The origin of
                            <strong class="subHeader">gIve</strong> lies in the belief that most people aspire to be contributors. We aspire to give
                            back to causes that align with our personal values. A common way to do this is through nonprofits
                            who focus on the areas that we care for. The problem however can be to
                            <strong>quickly</strong> and
                            <strong>easily</strong> find a nonprofit that is not only genuine but also meets other criteria that
                            we may have, be it the right location, the correct philosophy/vision or anything else.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            At
                            <strong class="subHeader">gIve</strong>, we believe that a common meeting ground between the nonprofits and the contributors
                            (whom we like to call â€˜gIvers') that allows for a fast and informed connection between the two
                            sides will be of great value for all.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            That is what
                            <strong class="subHeader">gIve</strong> strives to do.
